Welcome to your first notebook based project!

Projects allow you to practice and apply the skills you've learned in the DataCamp courses. In each project you will need to craft your own solution to a real-world task, using real-world tools and workflows.

The exception is this project, which is just an introduction to the DataCamp notebook project interface.

This project utilizes a data notebook (made by DataLab). Notebooks provide an interactive environment to perform data analysis, machine learning and other computational tasks. There are many notebook providers and getting familiar with them will help you prepare for real work.

Take a look at the provided notebook. It will guide you through using notebooks in DataCamp projects. By the end youâ€™ll be ready for your first real notebook based project. Good luck!
