Classify service desk tickets into categories using a CNN to streamline customer services.

Define a CNN classifier with the following layers: an embedding layer, a 1D convolution layer, and a linear layer.
Train your classifier on train_data using a suitable optimizer. Run your training for only 3 epochs.
Test your classifier on test_data, storing your predictions in a list called predictions.
Calculate the accuracy, per-class precision, and recall for your trained classifier on the test_data. Save the metrics as variables with the corresponding names: accuracy, precision, and recall, with precision and recall saved as lists.
