Online shopping has been rapidly evolving over the last few years, making our lives easier. But behind the scenes, e-commerce companies face a complex challenge that needs to be addressed. \n\nUncertainty plays a big role in how the supply chains plan and organize their operations to ensure that the products are delivered on time.
