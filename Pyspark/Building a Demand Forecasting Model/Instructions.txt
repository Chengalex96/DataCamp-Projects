Analyze the Online Retail.csv dataset and build a forecasting model to predict 'Quantity' of products sold.

Split the data into two sets based on the splitting date, "2011-09-25". All data up to and including this date should be in the training set, while data after this date should be in the test set. Return a pandas DataFrame, pd_daily_train_data, containing, at least, the columns "Country", "StockCode", "InvoiceDate", "Quantity".

Using your test set, calculate the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for your forecast model for the 'Quantity' sold? Return a double (float) named mae.

How many units are expected to be sold during the week 39 of 2011? Store as an integer variable called quantity_sold_w39.
